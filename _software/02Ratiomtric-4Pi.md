title: "Ratiomtric-4Pi"
excerpt: "Ratimotric-4Pi is a graphics processing unit (GPU) based global fitting algorithm for 4Pi-SMLM with flexible PSF modeling and parameter sharing, to extract maximum information from 4Pi single molecule data and achieved both good color separation and optimal 3D resolution. By partially linking the photon parameters between channels with interference difference of Ï€ during global fitting of the multi-channel 4Pi single molecule data, we showed on simulated data that the loss of the localization precision is minimal compared with the theoretical minimum uncertainty, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Our algorithm is implemented in GPU and the fitting speeds is more than 38 times faster than the CPU based code."
