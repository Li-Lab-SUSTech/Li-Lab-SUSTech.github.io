title: "fit3Dcspline"
excerpt: "fit3Dcspline is a GPU based 3D single molecule fitter for arbitrary, experimental point spread functions (PSF). The fitting speeds achieves more than 10^5 fits/s on a consumer graphic card GTX 1070. The implmentation of the fitting algorithm is based on maximum likelihood estimation and employs Levenberg-Marquardt optimization routine, which reaches theoretical minimum uncertainty. Both the EMCCD and sCMOS noise model are included. The softare package also includes tools to robustly model beads based experimental PSFs of different modality and correct for depth induce aberrations.<br/><img src='/images/fit3dcspline.png'>"
