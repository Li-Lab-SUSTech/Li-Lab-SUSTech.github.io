The relative slow scanning speed of a galvanometer commonly used in a confocal laser scanning microscopy system can dramatically limit the system performance in scanning speed and image quality, if the data collection is simply synchronized with the galvanometric scanning. Several algorithms for the optimization of the galvanometric CLSM system performance are discussed in this work, with various hardware controlling techniques for the image distortion correction such as pixel delay and interlace line switching; increasing signal-to-noise ratio with data binning; or enhancing the imaging speed with region of interest imaging. Moreover, the pixel number can be effectively increased with Acquire-On-Fly scan, which can be used for the imaging of a large field-of-view with a high resolution.
