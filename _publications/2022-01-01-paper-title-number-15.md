Since the 1990s, continuous technical and scientific advances have defied the diffraction limit in microscopy and enabled three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution  imaging.  An  important  milestone  in  this  pursuit  is  the  coherent  utilization  of  two  opposing  objectives  (4Pi  geometry)  and  its combination  with  super-resolution  microscopy.  Herein,  we  review  the  recent  progress  in  4Pi  nanoscopy,  which  provides  a  3D,  non-invasive, diffraction-unlimited, and isotropic resolution in transparent samples. This review includes both the targeted and stochastic switching modalities of 4Pi nanoscopy. The schematics, principles, applications, and future potential of 4Pi nanoscopy are discussed in detail.
