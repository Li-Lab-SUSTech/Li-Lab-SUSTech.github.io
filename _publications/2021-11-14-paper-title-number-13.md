4Pi single  molecule  localization  microscopy(4Pi-SMLM) with    two    opposing    objectives achieves    sub-10    nm isotropic   3D   resolutionwith as   few   as   250   photons collected byeach  objective.  Here,  we  developed  a new ratiometric  multi-color  imaging  strategy for4Pi-SMLM which  employed  the  intrinsic  multi-phase  interference intensitywithout increasing the complexity of the system and   achieved both optimal   3D   resolutionand   color separation.  By partiallylinking  the photon parameters between channels with interference difference of Ï€during global  fittingof the  multi-channel  4Pi  single  molecule data,  we  showed  on  simulateddata  that the  loss  of  the localization   precision   is   minimal   compared   with   the theoretical  minimum  uncertainty, the Cramer-Rao  lower bound (CRLB).
