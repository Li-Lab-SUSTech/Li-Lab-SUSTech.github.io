Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging of nanoscale structures within biological samples. However, prolonged acquisition introduces a drift between the sample and the imaging system, resulting in artifacts in the reconstructed super-resolution image. Here, we present a novel, to our knowledge, 3D drift correction method that utilizes both the reflected and scattered light from the sample. Our method employs the reflected light of a near-infrared (NIR) laser for focus stabilization while synchronously capturing speckle images to estimate the lateral drift. This approach combines high-precision active compensation in the axial direction with lateral post-processing compensation, achieving the abilities of 3D drift correction with a single laser light. Compared to the popular localization events-based cross correlation method, our approach is much more robust, especially for datasets with sparse localization points.
