By combining super-resolution photoactivation localization microscopy with single particle tracking, we have visualized the endocytic process in the live-cell environment with nanoparticles (NPs) of different size and surface functionalization. This allowed us to analyze the dynamics of NPs interacting with cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. We identified two distinctly different types of pathways by which NPs are internalized via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). Predominantly, NPs first bind to the membrane and, subsequently, CCPs form at this site. However, there are also instances where a NP diffuses on the membrane and utilizes a preformed CCP. Moreover, we have applied this new method to further explore the effects of size and surface functionalization on the NP dynamics on the plasma membrane and the ensuing endocytosis.
