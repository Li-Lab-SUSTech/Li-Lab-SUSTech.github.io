We present a fitter for 3D single-molecule localization of arbitrary, experimental point  spread  functions  (PSFs)  that  reaches  minimum  uncertainty  for EMCCD and sCMOS cameras,and achieves more than 105fits/s. We provide tools to robustly model experimental PSFsand correct for depth induced aberrations, which allowed us to achieve an  unprecedented3D  resolution  with  engineered  astigmatic PSFs,  and  acquire  high quality 3D superresolution images even on standard microscopes without 3D optics.
