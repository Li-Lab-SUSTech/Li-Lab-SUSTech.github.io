excerpt: 'Point spread function (PSF) engineering is an important technique to encode the properties (e.g., 3D positions, color, and orientation) of single molecule in the shape of the PSF, often with the help of a programmable phase modulator. Deformable mirror (DM) is currently the most widely used phase modulator for fluorescence detection as it shows negligible photon loss. However, it relies on careful calibration for precise wavefront control. Therefore, design of an optimal PSF not only relies on the theoretical calculation of maximum information content, but also the physical behavior of the phase modulator, which is often ignored during the optimization process.

Multi-channel detection in single-molecule localization microscopy greatly increases information content for various biological applications. Here, we present globLoc, a graphics processing unit based global fitting algorithm with flexible PSF modeling and parameter
sharing, to extract maximum information from multi-channel single molecule data.
