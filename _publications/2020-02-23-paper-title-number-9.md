Non-blinking,  non-bleaching  and  super-bright  single  upconversion  nanoparticles  have  been  recently discovered  with  non-linear  power-dependent  properties  and  can  be  switchable  under  dual  beam excitations,  which  are  ideal  for  super-resolution  microscopy,  single-molecule  tracking,  and  digital assays.  Here,  we  report  that  the  brightness  of  Nd3+-Yb3+-Er3+ doped  nanoparticles  displays  a  pair  of unusual double helix shapes as the function of power densities of 976 nm and 808 nm excitations. We systemically analyse the power-dependent emission spectra, lifetimes, and power-intensity double-log slopes of single upconversion nanoparticles, which reveal that the dynamic roles of Nd3+ ions in the tri-doped nanosystem with underlining electron population pathways are power dependent. That is, at high power 808 nm excitation, Nd3+ ions can directly emit upconverted luminescence, with their conventional role of sensitization saturated in the Nd3Yb3+Er3+ energy transfer systems. Moreover, we confirm that  the  universal  helix  shape  phenomena  commonly  exist  in  a  set  of  eight  batches  of  core-shell nanoparticles regardless of the doping concentrations of Nd3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in the sensitization shell,  migration  shell,  and  active  core,  though  the  crossing  nodes  occur  at  different  excitation  power ranges. This study emphasizes the important role of power-dependent properties in both improving the upconversion  emission  efficiency  and  the  design  of  non-linear  responsive  probes  for  imaging  and sensing.
