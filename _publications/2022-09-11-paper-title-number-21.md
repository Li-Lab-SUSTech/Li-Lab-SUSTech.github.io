Single-molecule imaging is widely used for reconstruction of three-dimensional subcellular structure. The point spread function is an important window to analyze the information of single molecule. Besides 3D coordinates, it also contains abundant additional information. In this paper, we reviewed the recent progress of multi-dimensional single-molecule imaging, including spatial location, fluorescence wavelength, dipole orientation and interference phase, etc. We also briefly introduced the latest methods for molecule localization and discussed the further directions.
