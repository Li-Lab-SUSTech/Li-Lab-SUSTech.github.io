<p>Fluorescence microscopy has become the most widely used technique in cellular biology for noninvasive, time-resolved imaging with high molecular specificity. However, the diffraction of light limits the resolution of standard microscopes to ~250 nm, thus preventing detailed analyses of molecular structures. The development of PALM/STORM super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has pushed the boundaries of optical resolution to a few nanometers so that an optical analysis of the nano-biostructures has become possible. However, the axial resolution of common 3D SRM is 40 â€“ 70 nm, which cannot resolve many cellular structures, especially not on the level of structural biology. My overall aim is to push the resolution limit of this technique down to < 10 nm in all 3D, enabling structural studies of large dynamic protein assemblies inside intact cells. </p>
